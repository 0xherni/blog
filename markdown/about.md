# Hey — I’m Herni

I’m a cybersecurity analyst based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with experience in SOC environments and enterprise security operations. I’m particularly interested in the intersection between **malware analysis**, **reversing**, and **practical detection engineering** — the “reverse → detect” loop.

## What I do (day-to-day)

- **SOC / Incident response:** monitoring, triage, containment, and reporting in a global environment using EDR/XDR, SIEM, and cloud-native tooling.
- **Security ops & hardening:** improving endpoint and cloud security posture with pragmatic, repeatable improvements.
- **Clear documentation:** I like turning messy incidents and research notes into structured write-ups.

## What you’ll find on this blog

For now, I’m keeping it simple:

-  **Windows API notes (3 per week):** short write-ups to learn what common APIs do and where they show up.
-  **PMRP notes (TCM):** occasional study notes from the course.

## Background & certifications

- SOC Analyst  — incident detection, triage, and response.  
- Former Technical Assistance for enterprise cybersecurity solutions.  
- Certifications: **eJPTv2**, **Blue Team Level 1**, **AWS Cloud Practitioner**  
- Currently: **Practical Malware Analysis & Triage (TCM) — in progress**
